# Introduction

Recent generations of the Intel® Xeon® family processors allow configurations
where:

1. Turbo Boost can be enabled on a per-core basis.
2. Some cores can be given a higher base frequency than others

# Overview

The scripts provided are as follows:

[power.py](power.md) allows the user
to adjust the frequencies and Turbo-Boost availability on a core-by-core basis.
This script allows the adjustment of P-states, C-states and Turbo-Boost.

[sst_bf.py](sst_bf.md) allows the user to confure the system for
Intel® Speed Select Technology - Base Frequency (Intel® SST-BF).
This allows some cores to run at a higher base frequency than
others.

[pwr.py](pwr.md) a python library which can be imported into an application,
to measure/modify core freqencies of a CPU to utilize Intel® Speed Select Technology.
