    stats: missing dimension in stat_set_simple_counter

    A simple counter is a two dimensional array by threads and
    counter index. 28017 introduced an error missing the first
    dimension.

    If a vector is updated at the same time as a client reads,
    an invalid pointer my result. This will be caught by the
    optimistic locking after copying out the data, but if
    following a pointer outside of the stat segment then
    the stat client would crash. Add suitable boundary checks
    for access to stat memory segment.
