Except as authorized in Section 2.1, you must not disclose this information to anyone, including the U.S. government. This Agreement will not become effective, or will automatically terminate, in the absence of a CNDA. This Agreement will take precedence in the event of a conflict with the CNDA.

6 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Your use of Material is at your own risk.

9 GENERAL. 
  9.1 Assignment. You may not assign your rights or obligations under this Agreement without Intel’s prior written consent. No third party will have any rights under this Agreement. 
  9.2 Dispute Resolution. If we have a dispute regarding this Agreement (other than for misappropriation of trade secrets or breaches of confidentiality obligations), neither party can file a lawsuit or other regulatory proceeding before the complaining party provides the other party a detailed notice of the dispute and our senior managers attempt to resolve the dispute. If our senior managers cannot resolve the dispute in 30 days, either party may demand mediation in which we will then try to resolve the dispute with an impartial mediator. If our dispute is not resolved within 60 days after the mediation demand, either party may begin litigation. 
  9.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by USA and Delaware law without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply. Except for claims for misappropriation of trade secrets or breach of confidentiality obligations, all disputes and actions arising out of or related to this Agreement are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Wilmington, Delaware and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. 
  9.4 Compliance with Laws. The Material is subject to, and You must comply with, applicable government laws and regulations, including without limitation U.S. and worldwide trade regulations prohibiting the export, import, or transfer Material to any prohibited or sanctioned country, person, or entity. You must not use Material for the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological weapons. 
  9.5 Severability. If a court holds a provision of this Agreement unenforceable, the court will modify that provision to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable or, if necessary, to sever that provision. The rest of the Agreement remains enforceable. 
  9.6 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in a writing specifying the waived provision signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. A signed waiver will not constitute waiver of any other provision. Failure or delay in enforcing any provision will not operate as a waiver. 
  9.7 Entire Agreement. Except for any non-disclosure agreement between you and Intel, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, between Intel and you concerning its subject matter.

	(c) your assertion that any Intel Component, Material, or product based on any Intel Component or Material infringes your patents.
